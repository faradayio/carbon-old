= Carbon

Carbon is a Ruby API wrapper for the {Brighter Planet emission estimate web service}[http://carbon.brighterplanet.com]. Use it to calculate emissions generated by certain activities, such as flights, automobile travel, housing, etc.

See http://carbon.brighterplanet.com for more information.

== Installation

    $ gem install carbon

== Usage

Carbon works by extending any Ruby class you're using to represent an emission source. For instance, let's say you have a RentalCar class that represents a rental car on your lot:

    class RentalCar
      attr_accessor :year, :make, :model, :fuel_efficiency, :daily_distance_average, :purchase_date, :retirement_date
    end

In order to calculate carbon emissions, we need to map each of the car's attributes to characteristics that are used by the {emission estimate web service}[http://carbon.brighterplanet.com].

    require 'carbon'
    class RentalCar
      attr_accessor :year, :make, :model, :fuel_efficiency, :daily_distance_average, :purchase_date, :retirement_date
      include Carbon
      emit_as :automobile do
        provide :model_year, :as => :year
        provide :make
        provide :model
        provide :fuel_efficiency
        provide :daily_distance_estimate, :as => daily_distance_average
        provide :acquisition, :as => :purchase_date
        provide :retirement, :as => :retirement_date
      end
    end

When you want to calculate emissions, simply invoke <tt>RentalCar</tt>#<tt>emission</tt>.

    my_car = RentalCar.new(...)
    puts "I generated #{my_car.emission} kg of CO2e"

Wait, how did you know the emission units were in kilograms?

    my_car.emission.emission_units #=> 'kilograms'

And what's the evidence that this number is accurate?

    my_car.emission.methodology #=> 'http://carbon.brighterplanet.com/automobiles.html?[...]'

Those are the important parts. Note that <tt>Carbon</tt> mixes right in to <tt>ActiveRecord</tt> models without causing problems.
