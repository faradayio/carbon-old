  # Let's start off by saying that <tt>EmissionEstimate</tt> objects quack like numbers.
  #
  # So, you can just say <tt>my_car.emission</tt> and you'll get something like <tt>4308.29</tt>.
  #
  # At the same time, they contain all the data you get back from the emission estimate web service. For example, you could say <tt>puts my_donut_factor.emission.oven_count</tt> (see the tests) and you'd get back the oven count used in the calculation, if any.
  # 
  # Note: <b>you need to take care of storing emission estimates to local variables!</b> The gem doesn't cache these for you. Every time you call <tt>emission</tt> it will send another query to the server!
