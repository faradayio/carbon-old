    # If you don't use the <tt>:as</tt> option, the name of the getter method will be guessed.
    #
    # There are two optional parameters:
    # * <tt>:of</tt> - the owner of a nested characteristic. So to send <tt>model[name]</tt> you write <tt>provide :name, :of => :model</tt>
    # * <tt>:as</tt> - the local getter name. So if Brighter Planet expects <tt>fuel_efficiency</tt>, and you only have <tt>fuel_economy</tt>, you can write <tt>provide :fuel_efficiency, :as => :fuel_economy</tt>.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #    emit_as :automobile do
    #      provide :make                                    # "I will send the value of #make as 'make=X'"
    #      provide :model, :as => :my_funny_name_for_model  # "I will send the value of #my_funny_name_for_model as 'model=X'"
    #      provide :name,  :of => :make                     # "I will send the value of #make_name as make[name]=X" (note: getter method name was guessed)
    #    end

    # sabshere 7/17/10 - is this a good place to allow a "units" option? this would probably just be for enforcement, i don't think we would accept non-standard units
